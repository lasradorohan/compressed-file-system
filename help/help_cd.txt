Usage: cd path

Action: Changes current directory to that specified by `path`.
Path is relative to current folder.
For absolute path start with '~/';

Example Usages:
  cd ./fol2/fol3
  cd fol2/fol3/
  cd ~/fol1/fol2/fol3/
  
In current implementation, when an inner folder of `path` is not found, cd falls back to inner most reachable folder.
